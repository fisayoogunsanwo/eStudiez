eStudiez Website

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
PROBLEM 
Education is a primary necessity and for Parents/Guardians to be updated about their wards, progress is even more important. Students who fail in exams might not reveal their marks to their Parents/Guardians because of fear. Teachers too are overloaded with work, because of which it becomes difficult to remember each child’s academic progress. Also, students too must be kept aware about their score progress and marks required for passing External Exams.

PROPOSED SOLUTION
A Website named 'eStudiez' which will be intended to track academic progress of a student. This system will allow various types of users such as Students, Parents/Guardians, and Teachers to view and track progress.
 Students who have fared poorly will be provided additional study resources via this portal to improve their future performance. This portal will also provide information regarding Revision classes that can help to boost performance. Each student’s progress can be viewed and tracked by Students themselves and their Parents/Guardians.

SCOPE OF PROJECT
This Web portal will be a responsive and visually appealing Website to be used by individuals (Students, Parents/Guardians, and Teachers). The website should display a student portal for students and parents to be in the loop of the academic progress of their ward.

CONSTRAINTS
The Web portal will not have any facility to store information on the server. Information can be fetched from pre-populated JSON or TXT files and displayed, however, information cannot be written to the files from within the portal.
